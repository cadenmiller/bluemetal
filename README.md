# Bluemetal Engine

![bluemetallogo](Images/bluemetal_logo.png)

Bluemetal Engine is a powerful and versatile game engine built using modern C++17/20 features. It incorporates cutting-edge technologies such as Vulkan Renderer, a custom configuration language called Noodle, Dear ImGui for user interface, and open-source libraries like SDL2 and VMA.

## Features

- **Use of Newer C++17/20 Features:** Bluemetal Engine takes advantage of the latest features provided by C++17/20, offering improved performance, better code organization, and enhanced productivity.

- **Vulkan Renderer:** The engine employs the Vulkan API, which provides high-performance graphics rendering capabilities. Vulkan enables efficient utilization of modern hardware, delivering stunning visuals and smooth gameplay.

- **Dear ImGui:** Bluemetal engine integrates Dear ImGui, a popular and intuitive user interface library. With Dear ImGui, developers can create and customize game tools, debug panels, and other graphical interfaces to enhance their workflow.

- **Open Source Libraries:** Bluemetal Engine leverages open-source libraries like SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and VMA (Vulkan Memory Allocator) to streamline development and provide a solid foundation for cross-platform support, input handling, and efficient memory management.

#### Warning: Still in development, not production ready.
